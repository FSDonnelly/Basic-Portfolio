            <p>I would like to learn the fundamentals of coding for web development and game design.  By completing the pre-work, I feel I am taking the first steps towards a future of limitless possibilities. With computers, laptops, tablets, and smart phones so readily available it is obvious that having the knowledge and skill set of coding will be highly desired in the work force as well as everyday life. It is interesting to learn the foundation on which how websites and programs function. I have always been interested in computers since I was about 11 years old and I got my first IBM clone with a 386 processor. It forced me to learn DOS commands and sparked a real interest for me. Unfortunately, when I started to get older the interested faded as I became more involved in skateboarding, snowboarding, and high-school football. I went to college and started working in the finance industry. Recently the finance industry has not been as rewarding so I decided it was time to take a step back and decide where I wanted my life to go next. After speaking with a friend (who had recently been laid off) that had just completed the UCSD Coding Boot Camp, it made me realize my lost interest in computers, programing, and coding. That day I made the call and started the enrollment process to attend.</p>
            <p>I would like to get a position working in web development or game design. I know that I am still very much an amateur. So initially I would like to find some entry level work assisting with web development or game design either through temp agency, referral, or private contracting. I have a few friends that own or operate small businesses, so I am exploring the possibility of helping them with web design, presence, etc. In all honesty I donâ€™t exactly know what I will do with what I learn in this course, but I am excited to learn it and I am sure as I gain more knowledge the professional direction I want to take will be clear.</p>
